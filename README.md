### Terraform Files Structure:
* main.tf: Defines the AWS provider and modules.
* network.tf: Defines the VPC, subnets, security groups, and other networking resources.
* ecs.tf: Sets up the ECS cluster and services.
* rds.tf: Configures the RDS database.

### Supporting Engineers:
* Documentation: Provide detailed documentation explaining each module, variable, and output in your Terraform configuration. Include instructions on how to modify configurations for new services.

* Training: Conduct training sessions for your team on how to use Terraform and AWS. Share best practices for microservices deployment and ECS.

* Code Review: Encourage engineers to submit Terraform code through a code review process. This ensures that configurations are consistent, secure, and adhere to best practices.

* Support Channel: Set up a dedicated communication channel (e.g., Slack channel) where engineers can ask questions and seek support. Regularly check and respond to queries promptly.
